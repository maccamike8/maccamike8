The first interview will be conducted before you start the current short course, and the second interview after the course is finished. Each interview will last around 30-40 minutes. During these interviews, you will be asked questions about your goals, reasons for studying the short course, your attitudes towards university study, and how these viewpoints may change as you engage with the current course. Interviews will be conducted in the strictest confidence and no personally identifiable information will be released. Participation will also let you experience first-hand some business-oriented research that has important commercial implications for universities worldwide. </p><p>The decision to participate is entirely voluntary. If you are interested in getting involved, Jason will email you an information sheet as well as a consent form, which you will need to sign and return directly to Jason. If you do agree to participate, you can opt out at any time. </p><p><b>Why Does it Matter?</b></p><p>Free short courses, also known as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) gained worldwide prominence in 2011 when two colleagues from Stanford University gave open access to their course on Artificial Intelligence, attracting 58,000 students. Since then, free short course platforms have sprouted quickly.  </p><p>There is concern, however, about the ongoing viability of these courses, which suffer from high attrition and are expensive to develop. A recent survey of four academic institutions found that their MOOC production and delivery costs ranged from $38,000 to $325,000. To recoup costs, these institutions have tried to establish revenue generating services – for example, requiring payment for tutoring or exams. To date, these is no evidence that any of these attempts have been successful.  </p><p>One possible approach, however, is to consider free short completion as a step towards formal university enrolment. Using free short courses as a pathway into university could allow them to become financially sustainable. From a students’ perspective, this approach offers a clear pathway from free, open-access education through to tertiary enrolment, thereby helping them to satisfy their academic and career goals. From a university perspective, increasing the number of students who enrol at university via a free short course pathway offers a valid business model that will encourage ongoing investment in free online course offerings. So if this model can be made to work, it’s a win-win situation!  </p><p>If you would like to get involved, please answer ‘yes’ to the quiz question above. You\'ll receive an information sheet and consent form via email.  </p></div></div>')})})
